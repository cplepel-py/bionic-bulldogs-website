# bionic-bulldogs-website
A repository for the development of the new RBHS bionic bulldogs website, and demonstrating new changes.

This repository is no longer maintained. The completed code for this version of the RBHS Bionic Bulldogs website can be found in a different repository, [github.com/cplepel-py/rbhs-robotics-website-flask](https://github.com/cplepel-py/rbhs-robotics-website-flask). That repository has also since been superceded by code available on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rb-bulldogs-robotics-website). The website can currently be viewed [here](https://rb-bulldogs-robotics-website.glitch.me/).
