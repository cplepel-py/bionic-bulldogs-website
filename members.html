Julian’s job as a coder is to make sure everything is ready for our competitions and tweak some codes. A little fun fact about Julian is that he started to code when he was in 5th grade and he really enjoyed it. He talks with other kids in this club and has made some of his closest friends in robotics.</div></div>

Alongside robotics, she is also involved with music and art programs. Including working with traditional and digital art, experimenting with animation, working with audio technology in the theatre program, and being a violist in the school’s chamber orchestra. She would like to incorporate the skills she develops in robotics to her ambition of someday working in 2D/3D animation, or game design, as a professional career.</div></div>

As a Junior, Sean participates in track & field, competing in events such as pole vaulting, the 100m, 200m and 400m. He also plays soccer and plays the clarinet in the band. Sean loves the color burgundy, because "it's kinda like red but cooler". Sean enjoys robotics due to the opportunities it has given him to learn more about STEM, in turn, making him want to eventually attend MIT for computer science/electrical engineering. He can heel click at impressive heights. Most importantly, Sean enjoys taking long walks on the beach.</div></div>

In her free time she loves to read, play with her dog Koby, and bake. A fun fact about Sofia is that she learned Java in middle school where she participated in Robotics for three years and is excited to keep learning new languages in high school. But her heart belongs to both worlds, the coding and building team. This year she has embraced the building team because there are enough coders and is still loving it! She is now the handyman around her house and loves fixing and tinkering  things. Robotics this year has taught her new things about the building aspect of the robot and using her brain more to think about design ideas. Sofia is elated to be part of the Robotics team this year!</div></div>

He has a creative mind and can come up with really good ideas when he puts his mind to it. He is also very friendly and enjoys having conversations with others. As well as being friendly, Josh works hard in school and gets good grades. He likes math and science more than any other subject, but still tries hard on the others. On the robotics team, he helps out wherever he can, although it is difficult for him to find a good place to help out. Overall, Josh contributes to the robotics team most by thinking of designs that would be most beneficial for the team to build on to the robot.</div></div>

This is his first year in robotics and although he does not know much, he is striving to learn and be a help to the team. In his free time, he is usually on his computer on discord talking to friends or doing homework. He sometimes likes to be alone but also enjoys the comfort of others. This relates to his awkward but fun personality. Other than robotics, he is active in a band and loves playing the saxophone. He finds a lot of enjoyment especially in the marching season where he can get hyped and spirited for the games. He is a simple but enjoyable person to be around.</div></div>
