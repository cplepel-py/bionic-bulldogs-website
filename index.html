<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are the Bionic Bulldogs, an FTC robotics team from Riverside-Brookfield High School in Riverside, Illinois. The 2019-2020 season was our third year competing in the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FIRST Technology Challenge</a>, and we won first place in the Inspire award in the <a href="https://www.firstillinoisrobotics.org/ftc/events/league-info.html?league=chicago-north&season=2019-2020">Chicago-North League</a>. Last year, we placed 5th in our league, and we won the Rookie of the Year award our first year. Each year, we strive to find innovative ideas to create a successful robot, always learning from our mistakes to do better than we did before. Learn more about <a href="robot">our robot for the current season</a> and <a href="members">meet our dedicated team</a>.</p>
<p>We also like to be a positive member of our community. Last year, we set up a tool library program in our local community, and this year, we plan to create a guide for new FIRST Tech Challenge teams. Learn more about <a href="outreach">our community outreach</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could not be successful without some help, and we are very thankful to <a href="sponsors">our generous sponsors</a>.</p>
